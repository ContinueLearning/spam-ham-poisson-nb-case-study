- Each entry is labeled as either `spam` or `ham` (not spam)
- We want to do hypothesis testing on this dataset

```
Let's imagine these are the messages in our inbox. Our hypothesis is 
that the percentage of spam in our inbox is greater than 12.5%.

Alpha is 0.025

Do we reject or not reject the null hypothesis? What's the p-value?
